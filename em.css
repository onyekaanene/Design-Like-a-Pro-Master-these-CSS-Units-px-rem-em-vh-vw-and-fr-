/*
3. em
What it is: em is a relative unit based on the parent element's font size.
When to use it: Useful for scaling elements relative to their parent. Be cautious, though, as it compounds when nested.
*/

.container {
  font-size: 18px;
}
.text {
  font-size: 2em; /* 36px (2 times the parent font size) */
}

/*
Pros: Flexible for creating scalable, hierarchical layouts.
Cons: Can lead to unexpected results when used in deeply nested elements due to compounding.
