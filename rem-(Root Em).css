/*
2. rem (Root Em)
What it is: rem stands for "root em". It's a relative unit based on the root element's font size (usually html).
When to use it: Ideal for responsive typography and scaling, as it scales uniformly across the page when the root font size changes.
*/

html {
  font-size: 16px; /* 1rem = 16px */
}
.text {
  font-size: 2rem; /* 32px */
}

/*
Pros: Scales uniformly with the root font size.
Cons: Can be difficult to manage when working with deeply nested elements.
